      Investors often discuss a concept known as the 'Time Value of Money'
      (TVM). This concept states that the sum of money is worth more now than it
      will be at a future date. This is namely due to the fact that its earnings
      potential will decrease over time. Essentially, money needs to be invested
      immediately so that it can earn interest, and the longer that money sits
      around and is not invested, the more its value erodes. Inflation is one
      key point of interest in TVM considerations, as inflation has a negative
      impact on TVM due to purchasing power decreasing as prices rise. If you
      want to calculate your TVM, it can be done by considering the amount of
      money, the future value, the amount it can earn, and the time frame. One crucial factor when assessing a TVM equation, is the effect of compounding periods. The closer together the compounding period, the greater the potential is for the value of money. For example, money invested in a savings account that is compounding daily, can generate more money than another account that only compounds annually. With these factors in mind, it is important to take away the fact that the future value of money is not the same as present day dollars. It is important to use TVM calculations to know how and when to spend, save, and invest.

      A common question often linked to GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) is, are they safe? Current research suggests yes, with 90% of scientists from the American Medical Association agreeing that GMOs are safe. Despite this, consumers remain weary of potential GMO side effects. Nearly 2/3 consumers doubt the trustworthiness of GMO foods, with concerns surrounding its impact on nutritional content, allergens, and potential toxic effects on our organs. So what does the data show? In theory, it is not possible to prove that food is safe, you can only prove that no hazard is shown to exist. In order to establish a study that would solidify the safety of GMOs, millions of dollars would need to be spent on a longitudinal study that would span decades. If we look in the opposite direction, there are a number of studies that exist which demonstrate positive correlations with GMOs. For example, one study conducted in Italy found that genetically engineered corn had a significantly higher yield than non-genetically modified varieties. It also showed that GMO corn contained less amounts of toxins produced by fungi. This is because GMO crops are geneticallty engineered to withstand insects and pests. These uplifting findings suggest GMO foods aren't all that bad.

      The future! Humankind has always been fascinated with what the future may hold. What will the world look like in the year 2100? There are three key topics to break down when it comes to the future of our planet. Firstly, climate change. It is certain that global temperatures will continue to rise these next few decades. The exact temperatures are impossible to predict, but some studies suggest a global temperature increase of 1.5&#8451 to 5&#8451. Make sure to put on your sunscreen! Secondly, population will increase as well. Recent studies suggest that our population will peak at approximately 9 billion people in the year of 2100. Most of this population growth will occur in Africa and Asia, with 9 out of the 11 billion people on Earth located on these two continents. This will greatly increase population density in these areas, and new questions of resource conservation will rise as demand increases in these areas. Lastly, technological advances must be considered. With the recent rise of AI, there is no telling what our job market will look like in the next few years. Many AI researchers predict that human-level AI will be achieved in the next few decades alone. While this may take away some jobs in the economy, it also provides opportunities for more free time due to greater automation!
